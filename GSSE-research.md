## Evolution of genetic systems and genomic conflicts

Conflicts manifest at multiple biological levels, including genomes, cells, individuals, and societies, yet their long-term consequences remain poorly understood. Although diverse forms of conflict are increasingly documented, their genomic distribution and impact on genome architecture remain largely unexplored, as many conflicts are transient and difficult to study. Our goal is to investigate the diversity of genomic conflicts, the molecular innovations they generate, and their effects on genome evolution. We study conflicts in ant societies, where reproduction is unequally distributed between queens and workers. This division of labor has repeatedly produced extraordinary genetic systems, in which selfish lineages drive their carriers to develop as reproductive queens, while the worker caste arises only through hybridization with another lineage. We investigate the mechanisms underlying these hybrid systems using population genomic and molecular approaches, focusing on the ants *Paratrechina longicornis* and *Wasmannia auropunctata*, where queens and males belong to divergent clonal lineages; the ant *Anoplolepis gracilipes*, where males are chimeras carrying divergent genomes in different cells of their body; and *Cataglyphis* ants, where two queen lineages coexist within populations and must hybridize to produce workers. These unique systems provide opportunities to study conflicts and investigate how they drive molecular and cellular innovations.
