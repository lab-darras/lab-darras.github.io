# Welcome to the website of the Haplodiploidy (Pan) and Genetic Systems (Darras) labs.
We are two closely collaborating research groups based in Mainz, Germany, studying the evolution of sex determination and genetic systems in ants, bees, wasps, and other haplodiploid organisms. Our labs share expertise and projects, while each pursues its own scientific directions and maintains an independent research identity.
